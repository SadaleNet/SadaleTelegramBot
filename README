# Sadale Telegram Bot

This is a extensible telegram bot developed by Sadale.

Currently it only supports deletion of old messages.

More feature will be added in the future, maybe.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Create the directory `data` inside the cloned repo
3. Create the file "token" inside
4. Put in your token inside the file
5. Run main.py with Python 3

If you wish to run the semi-automated test cases, create the directory `data/test`.
Then create a file named `token` inside and put your telegram bot token.

You'll also have to modify TEST_GROUPS_ID inside test.py to point to your
own telegram test group and telegram test super group.

Then run test.py and follow the instruction inside.
